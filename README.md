# pos
This Point of Sale system was built to modernize expensive POS systems in the restaurant industry.

Development ceased in 2011, and some of the core code, mostly handling product management, was integrated into the Vendevor ecommerce platform.  The POS system functioned similar to the Square Register today.

An Android app was integrated into the backend, but the front-end of the system was never updated beyond the CakePHP default styling.
